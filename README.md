# PyRedux Logging-Middleware

WIP: Api is unstable

includes basic implementations for:

    - Python-logging-module: with a colored-terminal-output and txt-file
    - Connector to [Redux-Devtools-remotedev-server](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev-server/tree/master)
    so you can see all actions and state-changes in realtime in the browser


More details will come
